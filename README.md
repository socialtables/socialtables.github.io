# Social Tables

The goal of this repo is to codify our engineering culture and keep clear our workflow options.

This repo uses [smudgedown](https://github.com/mcwhittemore/smudgedown) to seemlesses convert all *.html files from markdown to html transparently via the `git add` processes. To work on this please first run `make setup`. ALL COMMITS MADE IN HTML WILL BE OVERWRITTEN TRANSPARENTLY BY THOSE OF US USING MARKDOWN.
