# The Social Tables Pair Programming Guide

## What is pair programming?
Pair programming (sometimes referred to as peer programming) is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work as a pair together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in.

## Who?
You and another member of the Social Tables engineering team.

##Why?
To learn and share knowledge (supports Social Table value of Every Day is a School Day)
To write better, cleaner, robust code
To hold each other accountable
To build relationships with team members

## When?
- You have reached a block and need help from a peer
- To learn something new from someone

## How?
1. Check-In with your pairing partner 
 + BEFORE ANYTHING: Ask each other “How are you doing?”
   + Each person should be honest in his/her response. It’s ok to admit if you’re tired or don’t understand something 
2. Determine who will be driving and navigating. 
 + The driver
   + This individual will be touching the keyboard and following the directions of the navigator. Keep in mind that you are following the directions and not controlling the pairing session. You should, however, chime in if you have an alternative approach to what the navigator wants to do. 
 + The navigator 
   + This individual will be giving directions to the driver. 
3. Review the task at hand.  
4. Develop a strategy to tackle the problem.
5. Execute. 


## Pair Programming Success

**You will be successful if you:**
- Express your opinions and ideas 
- Appoint a driver and navigator and swap roles with clear communication
- Seek out and create space for your pair’s thoughts/opinions
- Are considerate of your pair
- Ask questions when you don’t understand something
- Discuss various options with your pair as well as pros and cons
- Demonstrate your ability to research methods, use console, debugger etc.
- Let your pair know when you need thinking time instead of going silent
- Experiment with the code and cultivate a spirit of play
- Display familiarity with learning objectives
- Use the knowledge you’ve gained to solve the challenge objectives
- Most importantly...have fun!

**You will not be successful if you:**
- Let your pair take over completely and “coast” through the session
- Act like you understand something when you don’t
- Do not contribute to the code
- Do not ask questions
- Expect yourself to be perfect
- Expect your pair to be perfect
- Prioritize completion over understanding
