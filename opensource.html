<h2> 1.When to make code public? </h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Code will be public when there is structure laid out for rest of the project.</li>
 	<li>An empty repo or an ambiguous project should not be public. </li>
 	<li>Code should not be public unless there is very good documentation </li>
</ul>
<h2> 2.Who owns the copyright?</h2>
<p>https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate</p>
- where should repo exist?
	https://github.com/socialtables
<h2> 3.what are the code standards?</h2>
<p>Contributor should follow socilatables style guides</p>
<h2> 4. Code Of Conduct</h2>
<p>Below is taken from http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct</p>
	<h3>Community</h3>
	
	
	<p>We want a productive, happy and agile community that can welcome new ideas in a complex field, improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between groups with very different needs, interests and skills.</p>
	
	<p>We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardise the participation of any person in the project.</p>
	
	<p>The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the project will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honoured by everyone who represents the project officially or
	informally, claims affiliation with the project, or participates directly.</p>
	
	<h3>Socialtables care about :</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Be considerate</p>
				<p>Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should consider them when making decisions.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Be respectful</p>
				<p>Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Take responsibility for our words and our actions</p>
				
				<p>We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Be collaborative</p>
				
				<p>What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts, it is the sum of many dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole.</p>
				
				<p>Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus</p>
				
				<p>Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.</p>
				
				<p>We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to structures with designated leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Ask for help when unsure</p>
				
				<p>Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Step down considerately</p>
				
				<p>When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so in a way that minimises disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>Leadership, authority and responsibility</h4>
	
	<p>We all lead by example, in debate and in action. We encourage new participants to feel empowered to lead, to take action, and to experiment when they feel innovation could improve the project. Leadership can be exercised by anyone simply by taking action, there is no need to wait for recognition when the opportunity to lead presents itself.</p>

	
	<p>Open meritocracy</p>

	<p>We invite anybody, from any company, to participate in any aspect of the project. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by any contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.</p>


	<p>This Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to distil our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.</p>
<h2>5.what is the practice for interacting with the community in terms of responding to issues/pull requests/comments?</h2>	
<h3>Pull Requests</h3>
	https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
	The core team of repo will be monitoring for pull requests. From here, you'll need to get another person to sign off on the changes and then merge the pull request. 
	<h4>Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is doneâ€¦</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Fork the repo and create your branch from master.</li>
		<li>If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!</li>
		<li>If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.</li>
		<li>Ensure the test suite passes (relavant test suite).</li>
		<li>If you haven't already, complete the CLA.(big corporations do this)</li>
	</ul>
<h2> how? </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Socialtables engineer could spent 3 hours a week working an open source project under socialtables repo</li>
	<li>Projects could either benefit socialtables or other technologies</li>
</ul>
